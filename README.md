<h1>Cub3D</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The goal of this project is utilize raycasting techniques to develop a graphical program that provides a "realistic" 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze, implementing realistic rendering and dynamic environments. The program is designed to be a tribute to the historic game Wolfenstein 3D, the first-ever first-person shooter.
<h2>How To Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/recozzi/cub3d_42.git</code></pre>
  <li>Move to the project's directory:</li>
  <pre><code>cd cub3d</code></pre>
  <li>Compile the project with Makefile rule:</li>
  <pre><code>make</code></pre>
  <li>Now you are ready to use cub3D</li>
  <p>Pass a map at your choice as arguments:</p>
  <pre><code>./cub3D maps/*</code></pre>
  <p>You can change the maze map and specifies various settings, such as the textures of the walls and the colors of the floor and ceiling. The maze map is made up of characters: '1' for walls, '0' for empty spaces, and 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W' for the player's start position and orientation.

  Once the program is running, use the left and right arrow keys to look around and the W, A, S, and D keys to move. Press ESC or click on the cross on the window's frame to exit the program.</p>
